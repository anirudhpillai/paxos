\section{Aims and Goals}
I have highlighted the aims and goals separately. The aims are what I want to
achieve out of undertaking this project and the goals are the things that this
project tries to achieve.

\subsubsection{Aims}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Learn about distributed system protocols
  \item Contribute to open source software
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Goals}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Read about and understand the classical Paxos-like consensus algorithms.
  \item Develop state transition systems for the algorithms and identify the invariants that need to be preserved during the operation of the algorithm.
  \item Implement a simulation of the protocols in Python.
  \item Formulate the implemented protocols in Disel by using the developed state-transition systems.
  \item Mechanise the proofs of the identified protocol invariants in Disel/Coq.
  \item Add additional communication channels and prove composite invariants.
  \item Provide an abstract specification of the protocol, usable by third-party clients.
  \item Mechanise a client application of the protocol verified out of the abstract interface.
\end{enumerate}

I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr Ilya Sergey, for making the time to
see me and arranging tutorials to help me understand the material for the project.
Without his guidance this project would never have been completed. From
undertaking this project and attending the reading groups arranged by him,
I have gained valuable knowledge that will help me throughout my career.

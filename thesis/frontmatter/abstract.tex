Distributed systems are notoriously hard to reason about.
This project aims to implement a library of reusable verified distributed components,
based on the classical family of fault-tolerant asynchronous Paxos-like consensus protocol.
The project will use Disel, a framework for compositional verification of distributed
protocols built on top of the Coq proof assistant, to verify correctness of the
implemented components.

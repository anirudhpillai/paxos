Distributed systems have become an integral component of the modern world.
Most of these system power application with over a million users and, thus,
the importance of correctly implementing such systems, that keeps them up and
running and functioning correctly, has never been greater.
Despite their widespread use, building correctly functioning distributed systems
has remained a notoriously hard challenge.

In this project we use Disel, a framework for $compositional$ verification
of distributed systems. Recent work has yielded tools that support building
verified implementations of the core components of a distributed system, yet,
Disel goes beyond them by enabling one to combine
the verified implementations of the core components to produce a
correct implementation of the entire distributed system.
This project aims to use Disel to implement a library of reusable
verified distributed components, based on the classical family of
fault-tolerant asynchronous Paxos-like consensus protocol, in which
a number of participant are supposed to reach
an agreement despite the possible failure of a minority of them.

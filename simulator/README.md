# Simple Paxos Python Implementation
This folder contains the Python implementation of the Simple Paxos
consensus algorithm. The details about the working of the algorithm can
be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/anirudhpillai/paxos/wiki/Simple-Paxos).

## Requirements
- Python 3

To run the implementation just run `./paxos.py`.

## Implementation Details
This is a simulation of the simple paxos algorithm. To simulate
asynchronicity, each node is modelled as a separate process.
